 When I started working at [Secret Escapes](https://secretescapes.com) a common practice was doing pair programming. For me this was pretty new and wasn't used at all to doing sessions of 30 mins or more of pairing with other people, previously I'd just pair for a couple of minutes with a coworker to solve small bugs and use this as a way to [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). 

So at the start, I must say,  I pretty much sucked at this and the sessions of pair programming with me where mostly one of the two persons just hacking the code till the issue / feature was implemented and the other one staying iddle and getting bored.

After some time of researching and searching through blogsposts, I found an amazing checklist made by the people of thoughtbot. All of these things are just recommendations and I'd suggest you to try things out, test what it works for you (and your coworkers) and discard the rest.

### What worked

Personally one of the things that worked the best when starting to try out this checklist was agreeing on the scope, it should be for both participants what you're trying to accomplish: either finishing a specific functionality, solving a bug or reaching certain point of an implementation. I felt pretty much worthless pairing for the sake of pairing.

Another point along the pairing that helped a lot for making pairing an experience much more enjoyable was doing intervals (time-based) and switching the driver / companion position. Setting timers of 3 to 5 minutes seem just about right for the pairing to be dynamic.

The experience should be pretty interactive all along, ideally the companion should ask questions or communicate his/her observations. The driver should be also explain clearly his/her thoughts along the process on the approach taken for solving certain issue or implementing a feature.

If you're a Front-end developer, using something like VSCode Live  code tool worked like a charm (sorry Vim ðŸ˜“).

### What did not work

On the other side, on the things that didn't work one of them was pairing for long periods of time. Pair programming by itself is quite exhausting and can drain a lot of energy. An hour of it seemed just about right to me before I start getting distracted or exhausted, this totally depends on you and on the person you're pairing with.

Something else that quite didn't work was having onne person doing all the coding, this leaves the other person in kind of an iddle state and is not an enjoyable experience for either participant. In the end neither of you will learn nor improve much.

### Final thoughts

I encourage you to try pair programming for half an hour or an hour whenever you've find the opportunity; some issue that you cannot crack; when implementing a feature that you might not be too certain about how to implement.
